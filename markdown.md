## [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org)
Mermaid is a web-based diagramming and charting tool that allows users to create diagrams and flowcharts using simple text-based syntax. It uses Markdown-like syntax to define diagrams and charts, which are then rendered into professional-looking diagrams.

Mermaid supports a variety of diagram types, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more. Users can create and edit diagrams in real-time using the Mermaid editor, which is integrated into many popular code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs).
